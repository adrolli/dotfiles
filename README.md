# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles

## Work-in-progress

As I am starting to merge my dotfiles from home (mac and pc mostly optimized for PHP / Laravel) and office (pc coming from a .net-world) this repo may be not very useful for you.

## More .files

If you work with PHP and specially Laravel on a Mac take a look at https://github.com/freekmurze/dotfiles or https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles.

If you want to see some extra-organized sets of dotfiles, see https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles or https://github.com/holman/dotfiles.

If you think "what the heck are dotfiles?", read https://driesvints.com/blog/getting-started-with-dotfiles/ and https://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked/.
