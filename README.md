I use a MacBook Pro 16 with M1 Max / 32 GB / 2 TB running on MacOS Ventura.

My setup is also optimized for mobile productivity as a digital nomad. Means, I use the MacBook Screen, an iPad Pro as second screen.

This are my settings, apps and configurations.

### Mac Settings

- Background -> Ventura Dark

- Trackpad -> Tap to Click (but how to drag-and-drop, e. g. Install software?)

- Setup [Sidecar](https://support.apple.com/HT210380)

  - iPad on the right side
  - Sidebar -> right
  - Touch Bar -> never

- Desktop and Dock

  - Size down, Magnification up
  - Minimize windows into application icon -> yes
  - Automatically hide and show the Dock -> yes
  - Automatically hide and show the menu bar -> Never

  

### Software
