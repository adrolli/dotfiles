# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles

As I am starting to merge my dotfiles from home (mac and pc mostly optimized for PHP / Laravel) and office (pc coming from a .net-world) this repo may be not very useful for you.

If you work with PHP / Laravel take a look at https://github.com/freekmurze/dotfiles or https://github.com/driesvints/dotfiles.
