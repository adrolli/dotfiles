# adrolli's dotfiles

I am a web developer preferably working with Laravel and the TALL-Stack using a MacBook Pro 16 running on MacOS Ventura.

My setup is optimized for mobile productivity. I use an iPad Pro as second screen, a Twelve South Curve Flex desktop stand, a Twelve South Hover Bar Duo for the iPad, and the Apple Magic Keyboard and Mouse. All these things fit in my Osprey Backpack.

## Dotfiles?

OK, but what is this repo for?

Working with the Terminal, VS Code and some other software is more efficent, if you prepare your machine with some shortcuts like aliases, keybindings etc. Another good thing is to have commands that help you to keep your machine up to date or reinstall everthing on a new Mac without pain.

- **.gitconfig** is my Git configuration
- **Aliases.md** is the readme file to remember my aliases
- **aliases.zsh** are my aliases, copied to the ZSH Custom folder
- **backup** saves my config files to iCloud, restore is made by install
- **install** is my install script, it will install a lot of tools
- **README.md** is the file you are currently reading
- **Shortcuts.md** is the readme file to remember my keybindings
- **update** is my update script, that will keep my mac up to date

As you probably see, this dotfiles-repo uses the KISS-approach, simple and stupid.

## More .files
